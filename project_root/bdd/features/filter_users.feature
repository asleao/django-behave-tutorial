Feature: Filter users by interest
As a standard user
I want to filter users by their listed interests
So I can find users who have similar interests to my own

Background: There are interests and users in the system
    Given there are a number of interests:
        |    interest           |
        |    Django             |
        |    Testing            |
        |    Public Speaking    |
        |    DevOps             |
        |    PHP                |

    And there are many users, each with different interests:
        |    name           |   interests                  |
        |    Billie Jean    |   Django, Testing            |
        |    Rocky Raccoon  |   Django, Public Speaking    |
        |    Major Tom      |   Testing, Devops            |
        |    Bobbie McGee   |   Public Speaking, DevOps    |

Scenario Outline: Filter users
    Given I am a logged in user
    When I filter the list of users by "<filter>"
    Then I see "<num>" users

    Examples:
        |    filter             |    num    |
        |    Django             |    2      |
        |    Django, Testing    |    3      |
        |    PHP                |    0      |
